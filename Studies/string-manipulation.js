/**
 * String-Manipulation
 *  0. In Javascript, strings are a datatype that represent words and sentences.  Like most things, they are stored in variables
 and can be denoted by opening and closing single or double quotes. There are two ways we can change or manipulate strings, methods and operatorss.
 *  1. Operators in Javascript can somethimes be used for various purposes. It is important to take context into consideration when examining what
 actions they might perform.
 *  2. Javascript also has a series of built in methods to manipulate strings. Some of these methods perform the same actions as some operators,
 and both are equally valid.
 */

 // 1. Operators //
 // The syntax for operators is as follows: the name of the string we want to manipulate, the operator, then what we would like to manipulate with.
 var word1 = 'Hello';
 var space = ' ';
 var word2 = 'World';
 var sentance = word1 + space + word2
 console.log(sentance) // logs ==> 'Hello World'
